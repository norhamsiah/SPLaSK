(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({
    headless: false
  });
  const context = await browser.newContext();

  // Open new page
  const page = await context.newPage();

  // Go to http://www.cloud-connect.asia/
  await page.goto('http://www.cloud-connect.asia/');

  // ---------------------
  await context.close();
  await browser.close();
})();
```

At the terminal, run the following command
```
$ node playwright.js
```

## Step 2.2: Screenshot website

  });
  const context = await browser.newContext();

  // Open new page
  const page = await context.newPage();

  // Go to http://www.cloud-connect.asia/
  await page.goto('http://www.cloud-connect.asia/');
  await page.screenshot({ path: `ujian.png` });

  // ---------------------
  await context.close();
  await browser.close();
})();
